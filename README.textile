rucksack is a Rails plug-in to pack and compress CSS- and JavaScript-files with the YUI Compressor. It's easy extendable to use other compressor-options like Packer, JSMin and CSSTidy.

Renaming for files managed by Git or SVN (as seen in earlier asset_package versions) are planned.

Inspired by asset_package and asset_compressor.

h3. Install

Install the plug-in from github:

  script/plugin git://github.com/yolk/rucksack.git

Create config/rucksack.yml:

  rake rucksack:install

Please reorder and remove files in config/rucksack.yml so dependencies are loaded in correct order.

h3. Deploy

Run

  rake rucksack:pack

on every deploy before restaring your appserver(s). Rucksack will silently fall back to your uncompressed assets when the files are missing.

If you use capistrano for deployment:

  desc "Pack assets with rucksack" 
  task :pack_assets, :roles => [:web,:app] do
    run "cd #{release_path} && rake RAILS_ENV=#{rails_env} rucksack:pack"
  end
  after "deploy:update_code", "deploy:pack_assets"
